Indian economy is at exception according to every theory and practical approach... So is Mr. Market... The chairman of NSEÂ  and Chief at SEBI are worried about the ongoing conditions... But situations continue to persist and rise higher and higher only because to make themselves secure from the on coming disaster... The standard companies are delisting and rest are opting to buyback their shares... The retail segment is pouring in money and new players and dominant players continue to play with these people moneyðŸ˜ŒðŸ¤“

"You have to live your life if youâ€™re going to do original work. Your work will come out of an authentic life, and if you suppress all of your most passionate impulses in the service of an art that has not yet declared itself, youâ€™re making a terrible mistake.

When I was young I led the life I thought writers were supposed to lead, in which you repudiate the world, ostentatiously consecrating all of your energies to the task of making art. I just sat in Provincetown at a desk and it was ghastly - the more I sat there not writing the more I thought that I just hadnâ€™t given up the world enough. After two years of that, I came to the conclusion that I wasnâ€™t going to be a writer. So I took a teaching job in Vermont, though I had spent my life till that point thinking that real poets donâ€™t teach. But I took this job, and the minute I started teaching - the minute I had obligations in the world - I started to write again."

\- Louise GlÃ¼ck\, awarded this year's Nobel Prize in Literature\.

We
look
at the
world
once, in childhood.
The rest
is memory.
